# Shortcut_maker v0.0.1

**Simple desktops task automatization**

Main idea was simplifying life (going from 15 clicks to 3 clicks of mouse).

This basically is simple "menu" of presets for my personal use (opening same apps in different workspaces/desktops, by same scenario)


**Supported:**
- Windows 10


**Required:**
- Python installed
- Eel library installed
- Define your presets in .py file (soon will be added other options)


## About

Script opens web based GUI menu for choosing preset. Then script opens needed apps in defined workspaces/desktops. This simply automates my routine. Project made for fun and because I'm too lazy.   


## Installation
- Just download new version of program
- Download all required software(Python and Eel library)
- Extract files from archive to folder you want
- Find in that folder "short_cut.py" - setup program for yourself (maybe change or add smth. Soon I will make this process a little bit easier) and run program
- Done âœ”
	- Now you saved 1 second of your life and made me happy (not sure)
